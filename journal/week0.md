## Destroy your root account credentials| Set MFA. IAM role

The root account is too powerful to be used for day to day administration and management of an aws account. It is recommended to create another account with Administrative acces that  should be used instead. 
Go to IAM and create an admin account woth admin acces and enable MFA on the account as well as the root account
Use the newly created account for daily management and administration of the account going forward.
Add the user to group if needed or attach a policy that grants the user admin access and click on create to create the account
